# FDM Employee Portal

## Project Overview
The FDM Employee Portal is designed to enhance employee management and internal operations within an organisation. It enables different user roles, such as employees, managers, consultants, and admins, to perform essential tasks like managing personal details, requesting leave, sharing files, and viewing team-specific news. The portal provides a centralised system that supports various levels of access and permissions depending on the user's role.

## Design
The following diagram provides an overview of the system's architecture, detailing the relationships between the main classes and how they interact within the portal.
